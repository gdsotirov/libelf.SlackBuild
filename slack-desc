libelf: libelf (an ELF object file access library)
libelf:
libelf: libelf lets you read, modify or create ELF files in an architecture-
libelf: independent way. The library takes care of size and endian issues.
libelf: For example, you can process a file for SPARC processors on an Intel-
libelf: based system. This library is a clean-room rewrite of the System V
libelf: Release 4 library, and is supposed to be source code compatible with
libelf: it. It was meant primarily for porting SVR4 applications to other
libelf: operating systems, but can also be used as the basis for new
libelf: applications (and as a light-weight alternative to libbfd).
